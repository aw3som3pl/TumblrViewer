Tumblr Viewer v1.0 Beta

<b>FEATURES</b>:
    * Browse Tumblr post feed by user Nick
    * Dynamic RecyclerView with infinite scrolling capacity (theoretically)

Used XmlPullParser instead of standard JSON parsing method ( I like challenges I guess)

<b>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT</b>:

* Will not open ANSWER type (original question source unknown from XML feed)

* No Unit / feature / Networking tests as of yet (time constraints / XML is hard to test thoroughly)

* UI / UX needs improvements

* No filtering for empty tags in REGULAR and QUOTE types

* Some VIDEO will not play due to corrupt link

* Some VIDEO thumbnails will not show up because of size

* Due to limited time there are some shortcuts if it comes to memory management and cleanup - sorry

** Improvements will proceed along with more spare time.
